# Codeabbey-solutions
These are my solutions to problems on CodeAbbey. They are primarily for my own personal backup and reference purposes.

I kindly ask that you do not copy these solutions and instead create your own solutions if you are also working through the CodeAbbey problems. You are of course free to look through the code and see how I solved some of the problems but again please do not copy them. Obviously I can't stop you from copying so this is just a polite request not to do so.
